**Curriculum** is a script that helps me print my C.V. in ASCII format.
All the sections of my C.V. are defined in the *parameters.yml*, which I can update at will.

As long as I have access to a computer, I always have an up-to-date C.V. at the tip of my fingers.

The C.V. structre consists of a header and two panes : left and right. Of course, it's possible to add or remove panes at will.

You can also define an ascii picture just like the sample one in the *parameters.dist.yml*. If you remove it, the header will just be rendered without it.
